# rynq
Rust Zynq Hardware Acceleration

RYNQ is an open-source project that makes it easy to design embedded systems with Zynq All Programmable Systems on Chips (APSoCs). Using the Rust language and crates, designers can exploit the benefits of programmable logic and microprocessors in Zynq to build more capable and exciting embedded systems. 
RYNQ users can now create high performance embedded applications with

parallel hardware execution
high frame-rate video processing
hardware accelerated algorithms
real-time signal processing
high bandwidth IO
low latency control

The primary purpose of RYNQ is to provide similar useability
As PYNQ but using Rust instead to enable highly productive development of hardware
Accelerated mission critical systems.
